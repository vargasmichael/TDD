** This is where I will be practicing my Test Driven Development.
** I use Jest as my testing framework.

\*\* In order to set up the environment using Node.js I will use an NPM package installer.

** run npm init-y This will stay with the defaults and create a package.json file
** run npm i-D jest This will install JEST as a Dependency.
** Once the installation is complete go to the package.json file and under scripts, change the value of 'test' to 'jest'.
** All test code is written in app.test.js and all functional code is written in app.js.
